# PassForge
This web app turns a short password into a strong one.

Web: https://jjcapellan.github.io/passforge/

**Important**: this web app is not a random password generator. The result is the same if the same parameters are entered. In theory, anyone could access this web app and create a new dictionary or even a rainbow table using existing password dictionaries (given the possible parameter combinations, the resulting dictionary would be millions of times larger than the original). Therefore, while the likelihood of this happening is minimal, it's mandatory to avoid using already compromised passwords.
